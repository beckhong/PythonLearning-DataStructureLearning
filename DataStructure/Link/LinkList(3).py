# This code creates three nodes, but we donâ€™t have a list yet because the nodes are not linked. The state diagram looks like this:
# To link the nodes, we have to make the first node refer to the second and the second node refer to the third:
node1.next=node2
node2.next=node3

# To pass the list as a parameter, we only have to pass a reference to the first node. For example, the function print_list takes a single node as an argument. Starting with the head of the list, it prints each node until it gets to the end:
def print_list(node):
    while node:
        print(node)
        node = node.next
    print("---")

    head = list
    tail = list.next
    print_backward(tail)
